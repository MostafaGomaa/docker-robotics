# LabGRAMRS 2016 ActorSim RCLL Images
This example contains images for using [ActorSim](http://makro.ink/actorsim/)
as the reasoning and coordination layer in the RCLL Simulation. Additionally,
this contains custom robot pod images for fawkes-robotino patches, e.g., to
publish the navgraph through the blackboard.

These images were created as part of a the lab course
[Goal Reasoning for Autonomous Mobile Robots in Logistics Scenarios](https://kbsg.rwth-aachen.de/teaching/WS2016/LabGRAMRS)
at the [Knowledge-Based Systems Group](https://kbsg.rwth-aachen.de) at
[RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de) in the winter
term 2016/2017.

ActorSim is connected via [jFawkes](https://www.fawkesrobotics.org/projects/jfawkes/).

The code itself resides in private repositories for the time being. This
docker image creation files serve as an example on how to create own custom
images for the RCLL simulation cluster. If you intend to use the ROS API,
please check the rcll-sim-rosplan image for an example.
